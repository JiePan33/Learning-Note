Some note that I didn't know before but important!

1.Difference between i++ and ++i. i++ means give the value of i first and then i=i+1. ++i means i=i+1 first then give the value of i. For instance, Given i = 1, a = i++ shows a = 1, i = 2; a = ++i shows a = 2, i = 2.

2.Hash
Definition: A hash is a function that converts one value to another. Hashing data is a common practice in computer science and is used for several different purposes. Examples include cryptography, compression, checksum generation, and data indexing. (Source: https://techterms.com/definition/hash)
Hashes are used to index data. Hashing values can be used to map data to individual "buckets" within a hash table. Each bucket has a unique ID that serves as a pointer to the original data. This creates an index that is significantly smaller than the original data, allowing the values to be searched and accessed more efficiently.(Source: https://techterms.com/definition/hash)
